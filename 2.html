  <h2>WINDOKU</h2>
  <p>Windoku, also known as the NRC Sudoku variant or HyperDoku, has all the rules of a “vanilla” Sudoku, with one addition: The four window panes with the blue background color must also contain digits 1 through 9. Many solving techniques for normal Sudoku can be used, but you will also need to use the 4 windows panes to check for singles, pairs, triples, and their interaction with rows, columns and boxes. The way the 4 window panes are positioned allow you to find 5 additional groups of cells where only digits 1 through 9 can go. </p>
